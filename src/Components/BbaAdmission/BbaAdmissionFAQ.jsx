  {
    question: "Can I apply if my 12th results are not yet declared?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you may apply with your latest available mark sheets (11th standard or 12th mid-term). Final admission will be subject to meeting eligibility criteria in final 12th results.",
  },
  {
    question:" Is work experience required for admission?",
    answer:
      "No, the BBA programme is designed for students immediately after 12th standard. Work experience is not required or expected.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have a passport currently?",
    answer:
      "You can apply and confirm admission without a passport. However, you must obtain a passport before the Semester 3 international internship (approximately 18 months after admission commencement), which provides sufficient time for passport processing. ",
  },
  {
    question: " When does the South Korea internship take place?",
    answer: "The two-week intensive international internship at Korea University occurs during Semester 3 (typically January-February of the second academic year), allowing students eighteen months to complete passport formalities and prepare adequately for international travel.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is mathematics mandatory in 12th standard for BBA admission?",
    answer:
      " No, mathematics in 12th standard is not mandatory. Students from any stream (Commerce, Science, or Arts) with any subject combination meeting the minimum percentage criteria are eligible for admission.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pursue MBA abroad after this BBA programme?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The BBA degree from Indira University is recognised for admission to master's programmes globally. International exposure through the Korea University internship, documented international experience, and Korean language skills actually strengthen applications for foreign universities.",
  },
